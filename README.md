# Zephyr_dakota_tutorial

Coupling of OpenFOAM libraries and Dakota for uncertainty quantificatioon purposes.

Part of the codes used have been used from the freely accessible resources online (https://www.ehsanmadadi.com/cylinder-mesh/, https://holzmann-cfd.com/community/training-cases/geometric-variation)

Part of the codes have been developed within out group by: N. Hobeika, I. PaÄ‘en and C. Garcia-Sanchez

Other contributors from the past work: J. Sousa, C. Gorle


## What is inside?

case16_probes: uncertainty quantification case for quasi-2D flow around a cube with post-processing of some probes

case16_coarse: uncertainty quantification case for quasi-2D flow around a cube with post-processing of full vtk surfaces (this case is very coarse mesh not good for CFD, but just for the training purpose)

Inside both cases the same structure is set-up with slight differences: 

+ cube_case: is the template case that is copied for each of the evaluations
+ postProcess: contains the python rutines to extract the probes/surfaces values for Umag/Udir and put them into a format that dakota can read
    + compute_Umag_Udir.py: it is run by the simulator_script/simulator_script_post and reads the results.N for each file and compiles a full file that then is used as input for dakota
    + extractStatsDakota.py: script to read mean/var/skew/kurt statistics from dakota.out file and put them into surface form (if post-process is with surfaces)
+ simulator_script: it is the script that controls all the tasks performed by dakota
+ simulator_script_post: same as the previous one but tricks dakota into doing only post-process (since we do not have pre-post feature in PCE, to use when all evaluations are run and just the post-process is missing)
+ dakota_pce_cube.in: input file for dakota that uses simulator_script
+ dakota_pce_cube_post.in: input file for dakota that use simulator_script_post

## How to run it?

+ clone the repository to your computer, and be sure you have OF8 and dakota6.13
+ lines to modify from the simulator_script:
    + (line 69) you need to sourc your own OpenFOAM installation
    + (line 76) if you do not have 8 processors, you will need to modify accordingly to availability in your system
    + according to the previous line you will need to change cube_case/system/decomposeParDict accordingly to the number of processors you use as well 
+ to run dakota: "dakota -i dakota_pce_cube.in -o dakota.out > stdout.out &"

## Features

The current set-up works with OpenFOAM 8 and Dakota 6.13.

## Configuration

The current set-up uses wind velocity and direction as uncertainty variables.
